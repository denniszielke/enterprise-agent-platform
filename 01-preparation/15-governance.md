# Governance and Traceability

> Status: Draft
> Canonical owner: Product or program lead - name to be assigned
> Required reviewers: CIO sponsor, architecture, security, engineering, operations, and assurance owners
> Gate: G1 and continuous governance
> Last reviewed: Not reviewed

## Governance principles

1. One accountable owner exists for each controlled artifact.
2. A proposal is not an accepted decision.
3. An assumption is not a source fact.
4. A designed control is not implementation or operational evidence.
5. A prototype result is bounded by its data, environment, method, and limitations.
6. Changed inputs propagate through explicit links and task-level replay.
7. Agents may recommend readiness but cannot record human approval.

## Roles

| Role | Accountable for | Required decisions or reviews |
|---|---|---|
| CIO sponsor | Approved enterprise mandate, vision, business goals and business risk | Sponsor review of G0, objectives and scope; sponsorship does not imply gate or operating-model decision authority |
| Product or program lead | Integrated plan, dependencies, scope, change, risks, gates | G1 and cross-phase coordination |
| Business owner | Narrative, journeys, operating outcomes, adoption | Framing and logical design review |
| Solution or enterprise architect | Design coherence, target architecture, NFRs, ADR process | G2 and G3 recommendations |
| Data owner or architect | Data purpose, model, quality, lineage, platform behavior | Data design and product mapping review |
| Security and privacy owner | Threats, identity, protection, policy, residual risk | Security reviews and exceptions |
| Engineering lead | Backlog, environments, implementation, automation, evidence | G4 recommendation |
| Test and evidence lead | Test strategy, reproducibility, measurement evidence | G4 and G5 evidence review |
| FinOps or finance owner | Cost model, rates, sensitivity, budget guardrails | G5 recommendation |
| Service owner or operations lead | Support, SLOs, procedures, rollout, recovery | G6 recommendation |
| Presentation lead | Decision narrative, claim traceability, review | G7 recommendation |
| Requesting user — G0 gate authority | G0 gate decision and conditions | Accept, hold, or return G0 |
| Gate authority | Gate decisions and conditions for G1-G7 when assigned | Accept, hold, or return the applicable gate |
| Operating-model decision authority | Capability-accountability and ownership-model decision | Accept, reject or defer the operating-model ADR after required evidence exists |

Use role placeholders until named people are provided. Never invent assignments.

The authoritative user statement dated 2026-09-01, made immediately after asking what G0 is, is: “authority is me.” This assigns the requesting user solely as **Requesting user — G0 gate authority**. It is an authority assignment only, not a G0 decision, and does not assign G1-G7, ADR, or operating-model decision authority.

## Artifact lifecycle

| State | Meaning | Downstream use |
|---|---|---|
| `Draft` | Material authoring is active | Exploration only |
| `In review` | Stable enough for named review | Gate preparation only |
| `Accepted` | Actual authority and reviewers approved it, with conditions recorded | Approved dependency |
| `Blocked` | A named unresolved input prevents completion | Not gateable without an explicit exception |
| `Superseded` | A linked accepted replacement exists | Historical reference |

## Phase task lifecycle

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Not started` | Dependencies have not yet been assessed |
| `Ready` | Entry conditions and direct dependencies are satisfied |
| `Blocked` | A named input, decision, owner, or environment is missing |
| `In progress` | The accountable role is executing the bounded task |
| `Replay required` | A changed input invalidated part of the task output or evidence |
| `Complete with evidence` | The completion check is met and evidence is linked |

## Evidence classes

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Source fact | Directly supported by supplied material |
| Assumption | Unverified statement with validation ownership |
| Target | Desired measurable state; not a forecast or achieved result |
| Proposal | Candidate direction awaiting decision |
| Accepted decision | Recorded authority accepted a choice |
| Designed | Specified but not executed |
| Demonstrated | Executed under stated test conditions by a cited external source or downstream workflow |
| Operational evidence | Observed in the intended live operating context by a cited external source |
| Future commitment | Planned work with ownership and dependencies |

## Traceability chain

```text
ASM/SCN -> GOAL/OBJ/SCP -> CAP/REQ/DES/NFR
        -> ADR/REAL/PROD/RISK -> IMP/FBB/CTX/HND
        -> EFF/COST/operations -> TEST/EVID -> CLAIM/validated scenario
```

Not every record needs every link. Every implementation-handoff item and presentation claim must trace backward to an approved need and forward to expected evidence, cited external evidence, or an explicit gap.

Tests use phase namespaces: `TEST-IMP-NNN`, `TEST-SIZE-NNN`, and `TEST-OPS-NNN`. The phase register owns the test plan. The [external evidence register](19-external-evidence-register.md) references results produced outside the architecture harness.

## Architecture-to-engineering boundary

The harness owns architecture definition and implementation context. It may specify:

- implementation scope, backlog, user stories, and functional building blocks;
- environment, release, deployment, migration, test, and operational requirements;
- code-generation context and prohibited decisions;
- sizing models and validation plans; and
- operating models, procedures, rollout, recovery, and readiness plans.

The default final delivery is `DEL-001`. Its canonical definition and assessment rules are in [the architecture-validated scenario](../07-presentation/76-validated-scenario.md).

The downstream implementation workflow owns source code, infrastructure code, pipelines, deployments, test execution, generated artifacts, releases, and measured implementation or operating results. Link relevant results back as external evidence; do not copy delivery artifacts into this repository.

## Change control

1. Record a material changed input as `CHG-NNN` in [16-change-impact-register.md](16-change-impact-register.md).
2. Identify the canonical source and compare old and new meaning.
3. Traverse direct links, then phase-plan dependencies.
4. Mark affected tasks `Replay required`; do not rewrite accepted history silently.
5. Update the canonical owner first, then summaries and downstream artifacts.
6. Re-run tests and gate checks whose evidence or conditions changed.
7. Close the change only when affected links, decisions, evidence, and gates are reconciled.

## Gate decisions

A gate record includes scope, date, authority, readiness recommendation, evidence reviewed, decision (`Accepted`, `Accepted with conditions`, `Hold`, or `Returned`), conditions, dissent, accepted risks, and follow-up owners. Document completeness alone is not a gate decision.
